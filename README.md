Landing Page Project (TOP)

The first project out of the TOP learning path.

Created a landing page by using the skills and material learned until now (basic HTML and CSS).

Learning continues and will come back to this project on a later stage and update it with the newly learned skills (next lesson is where the JavaScript part starts)
